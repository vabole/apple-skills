## The Vision

> "More expressive and delightful while being instantly familiar"
> — Alan Dye, VP of Human Interface Design

Liquid Glass balances **innovation with user comfort**—pushing design forward while maintaining intuitive familiarity.

## Core Properties

### Material Characteristics
Liquid Glass is a translucent material with the optical qualities of real glass:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Translucency** | Color informed by surrounding content |
| **Refraction** | Content refracts through the material |
| **Reflection** | Reflects wallpaper and environment |
| **Adaptation** | Intelligently adapts between light and dark |
| **Specular highlights** | Real-time rendered shine |
| **Dynamic response** | Reacts to movement for lively experience |

### Visual Inspiration
Liquid Glass draws from visionOS's depth and dimensionality, leveraging Apple's advances in:
- Hardware capabilities
- Silicon performance
- Graphics technologies

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Content Focus
**Controls give way to content.**

In iOS 26:
- Tab bars shrink during scrolling
- Controls morph dynamically as user needs change
- Navigation remains accessible while emphasizing content
- Glass frames rather than obscures

### 2. Contextual Adaptation
**Materials refract and reflect their surroundings.**

The interface maintains user context:
- Glass refracts surrounding content
- Reflects wallpaper beneath
- Lock Screen time is crafted from Liquid Glass
- Fluidly adapts behind photo subjects

### 3. Platform Harmony
**Unified design across all Apple platforms.**

For the first time:
- iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS share design language
- Each platform preserves its distinct qualities
- Same identity, contextual expression
- Consistency without uniformity

## What Liquid Glass Affects

### System-Wide Changes
- Buttons, switches, sliders
- Text and media controls
- Tab bars and sidebars
- Lock Screen, Home Screen
- Notifications, Control Center
- Dock and widgets

### App Icons
Multi-layered Liquid Glass construction:
- Translucent layers
- Glass-like shimmer
- Beautiful across appearance modes
- Work with tint variations

### Navigation Elements
- Floating tab bar (collapses on scroll)
- Transparent toolbars
- Morphing sheets
- Contextual controls

## Design Principles in Practice

### Hierarchy
**Glass floats above content.**
- Controls appear on glass layer
- Content lives beneath
- Clear visual separation
- Never mix control and content layers

### Harmony
**Software aligns with hardware.**
- Concentric corners match device
- Fluid gestures feel natural
- Materials respond to environment
- Design feels "at home" on device

### Consistency
**Same identity, contextual expression.**
- Apps feel unified across platforms
- Each platform's strengths preserved
- Familiar patterns, fresh execution
- Brand identity travels with design

## Customization

macOS Tahoe 26 introduces:
- Light/dark appearances
- Colorful tints
- Elegant new "clear look"
- Completely transparent menu bar (maximizes display)

## Developer Enablement

### Automatic Adoption
- SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit updated APIs
- Easy adoption for most apps
- Standard controls get glass automatically

### Tools
- **Icon Composer** in Xcode 26 for Liquid Glass icons
- Renders beautifully across appearances and tints
- Design resources for all platforms

## The Emotional Goal

Liquid Glass aims to create interfaces that are:
- **Expressive**: Apps have personality
- **Delightful**: Interactions feel rewarding
- **Familiar**: Instantly understandable
- **Alive**: Dynamic and responsive
- **Premium**: Elevated quality feel

## Award-Worthy Design Through Glass

To create Apple Design Award-worthy apps with Liquid Glass:

1. **Embrace the material**: Don't fight glass—let it enhance
2. **Focus on content**: Glass should frame, not compete
3. **Use color intentionally**: Sparingly in glass, expressively in content
4. **Design for depth**: Think in layers
5. **Respect the system**: Follow glass conventions
6. **Add distinctive details**: Personality in content layer
7. **Polish interactions**: Haptics, animations, transitions

## What Makes It Different

| Pre-Liquid Glass | Liquid Glass Era |
|------------------|------------------|
| Solid backgrounds | Translucent materials |
| Fixed navigation | Morphing controls |
| Platform-specific design | Unified language |
| Backgrounds behind content | Content visible through controls |
| Static materials | Dynamic, responsive glass |

> This philosophy guides all design decisions in iOS 26+. When in doubt, ask: "Does this let content shine through while maintaining intuitive control?"
